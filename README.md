A comprehensive list of roxygen tags and their use cases.

**_Note:_** _Please treat this similar to an awesome list_ 

# Preface

Roxygen tags are not well documented as seen in [klutometis/roxygen#792](https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen/issues/792).  Many people use roxygen to document their R packages, so this repository is meant to help develop that list further for the community.  

The previous issue contains a list of links to server as a initial resource for roxygen tags.

## Tags

**_Note:_** _When referencing a roxygen tag, be careful not to accidentally tag someone using the `@` symbol._

# roxygen-tags [![Awesome][awesome-badge]](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A comprehensive list of roxygen tags and their use cases.

**_Note:_** _Please treat this similar to an awesome list_ 

# Preface

Roxygen tags are not well documented as seen in https://github.com/klutometis/roxygen/issues/792.  Many people use roxygen to document their R packages, so this repository is meant to help develop that list further for the community.
